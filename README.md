# 🏢 Agency Appointment System

A simple **Appointment Booking and Token Management System** built for the **Qwiik Technical Test**.  
The project allows an agency to manage customer appointments, issue tokens, and visualize the daily queue.  
It also includes additional management features such as defining off days and setting maximum daily appointments.

- 📅 Agency can **set a daily appointment limit** — extra bookings are automatically moved to the next available day.
- 📘 All API endpoints are **documented with Swagger**.
- 🧠 **Separation of Concerns** between Business Logic and Web Layer.
- 🔁 Supports **Dependency Injection (IoC)** and **Extensibility** via Autofac.
- 🧩 Simplified code using **LINQ**.
- ✅ Includes **Unit Tests**.
- ☁️ Ready for **Azure deployment**.
- 🔗 Source control managed via **GitHub**.
